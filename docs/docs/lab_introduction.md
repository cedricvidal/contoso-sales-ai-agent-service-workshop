# Getting Started with the Workshop

This workshop is designed to help you get started with the Azure AI Agents Service and the Python SDK. The workshop is divided into multiple labs, each focusing on a specific feature of the Azure AI Agents Service. The labs are designed to be completed in sequence, with each lab building on the previous one.

## Lab Structure

Each lab in this workshop has an **introduction** that explains the relevant concepts, this is followed by an **exercise** that guides you through the process of implementing the feature.

## Understanding the Project Structure

When you open the workshop in Visual Studio Code, you will see the following folder structure. Make a note of the key folders and files that you will be working with during the workshop. The key folders and files are:

1. The **instructions** folder contains the instructions for each lab. Contains the instructions passed the LLM.
2. The **main.py** file is the entry point for the application. This file contains the main logic for the application.
3. The **sales_data.py** file contains the function logic to execute dynamic SQL queries against the SQLite database.
