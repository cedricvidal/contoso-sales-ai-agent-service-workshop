# Getting Started with the Workshop

This workshop is designed to help you get started with the Azure AI Agents Service and the Python SDK. It is divided into multiple labs, each focusing on a specific feature of the Azure AI Agents Service. The labs are intended to be completed in sequence, with each lab building on the previous one.

## Lab Structure

Each lab in this workshop includes:

- An **Introduction**: Explains the relevant concepts.
- An **Exercise**: Guides you through the process of implementing the feature.

## Understanding the Project Structure

When you open the workshop in Visual Studio Code, you will see the following folder structure. Take note of the key folders and files you will be working with during the workshop:

1. The **instructions**: folder contains the instructions passed to the LLM.
2. The **main.py**: The entry point for the application, containing its main logic.
3. The **sales_data.py**: Contains the function logic to execute dynamic SQL queries against the SQLite database.
4. The **stream_event_handler.py**: Contains the event handler logic for token streaming.
