# Lab 6 Instrumentation

## Introduction

Troubleshooting and debugging complex agents can be challenging due to the high number of steps, variability in execution sequences based on user input, lengthy inputs and outputs requiring detailed inspection, and nested processes where tools invoke other tools. Tracing addresses these challenges by providing a clear, sequential view of the inputs and outputs at each stage of an agentâ€™s execution, making it easier to identify and resolve issues.
