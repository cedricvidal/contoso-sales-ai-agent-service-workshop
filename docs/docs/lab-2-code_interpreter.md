# Lab 2 Intro to the Code Interpreter

## Introduction

The Azure AI Agent Service Code Interpreter enables the LLM to generate Python code for tasks such as creating charts or performing complex data analyses based on user queries. It leverages natural language processing (NLP), sales data from an SQLite database, and user prompts to automate code generation. The LLM-generated Python code executes within a secure sandbox environment, utilizing a restricted subset of Python to ensure safe and controlled execution.

## Lab 2 Exercise

In this lab, you will enable the Code Interpreter to execute Python code generated by the LLM.

1. Open the `main.py` file in the `src/workshop` folder.
2. **Comment** out the `INSTRUCTIONS_FILE = "instructions/instructions_function_calling.txt"` line.
3. **Uncomment** the `# INSTRUCTIONS_FILE = "instructions/instructions_code_interpreter.txt` line.
4. **Uncomment** the `# code_interpreter = CodeInterpreterTool()` line.
5. **Uncomment** the `# toolset.add(code_interpreter)` line.
6. Review the code in the `main.py` file. You code should look like the following:

    ``` python
    # INSTRUCTIONS_FILE = "instructions/instructions_function_calling.txt"
    INSTRUCTIONS_FILE = "instructions/instructions_code_interpreter.txt"
    # INSTRUCTIONS_FILE = "instructions/instructions_code_bing_grounding.txt"

    sales_data = SalesData()
    utilities = Utilities()

    user_async_functions: Set[Callable[..., Any]] = {
        sales_data.async_fetch_sales_data_using_sqlite_query,
    }

    project_client = AIProjectClient.from_connection_string(
        credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
        conn_str=PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING,
    )

    functions = AsyncFunctionTool(user_async_functions)
    code_interpreter = CodeInterpreterTool()
    # bing_connection = project_client.connections.get(connection_name=BING_CONNECTION_NAME)
    # bing_grounding = BingGroundingTool(bing_connection)

    toolset = AsyncToolSet()
    toolset.add(functions)
    toolset.add(code_interpreter)
    <!-- # toolset.add(bing_grounding) -->
    ```

6. Review the `instructions/instructions_code_interpreter.txt` file. This file provides the LLM with instructions on how to utilize the Code Interpreter.
7. Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to run the application.
8. In the terminal, you will see the application start and the LLM prompt you for a question. Ask a question about Contoso sales data, such as "**Show sales by region as a pie chart**".
9. The LLM calls the `async_fetch_sales_data_using_sqlite_query` function to execute a dynamic SQL query on the SQLite database to return the relevant data from the database.
10. The LLM then writes the appropriate Python code to generate a pie chart based on the data retrieved from the database.
11. When the task completes, you'll find the generates pie chart image in the `src/workshop/files` folder.
12. Click on the image to view the pie chart in Visual Studio Code.
