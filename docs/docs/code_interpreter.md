# Lab 2 Intro to the Code Interpreter

The Azure AI Agent Search Code Interpreter is a tool that leverages natural language processing (NLP), sales data from the SQLite database, and user prompt context to generate appropriate Python code.

Operating within a sandbox environment for safety, it uses a limited subset of Python to ensure security. The tool responds to user questions by automating the generation and execution of code. For example, the LLM can generate Python code to create charts, or perform more complex analysis of data.
