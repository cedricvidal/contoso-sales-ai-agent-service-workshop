# Security Concerns

## Malicious SQL Attacks

A common concern with SQL dynamically generated by LLMs is security, particularly the risk of SQL injection or malicious actions, such as dropping or tampering with the database. While these concerns are valid, they can be effectively addressed by properly configuring database access permissions.

For SQLite, this means configuring the database as read-only. For database services like Postgres or Azure SQL, you should assign the application a read-only (Select) role. Running the application in a secure environment adds an extra layer of protection as well.

In enterprise scenarios, data is extracted and transformed from operational systems into a read-only database or data warehouse with a user friendly schema. This approach ensures the data is secure, optimized for performance, and that the application has read-only access to the data.
