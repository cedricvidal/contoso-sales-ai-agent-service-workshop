# Security Concerns

## Malicious SQL Attacks

A common concern with SQL dynamically generated by LLMs is security, particularly the risk of SQL injection or malicious actions, such as dropping or tampering with the database. While these concerns are valid, they can be effectively mitigated by properly configuring database access permissions.

For SQLite, this involves configuring the database as read-only. For database services like PostgreSQL or Azure SQL, the application should be assigned a read-only (SELECT) role. Running the application in a secure environment further enhances protection.

In enterprise scenarios, data is typically extracted and transformed from operational systems into a read-only database or data warehouse with a user-friendly schema. This approach ensures that the data is secure, optimized for performance and accessibility, and that the application has restricted, read-only access.
