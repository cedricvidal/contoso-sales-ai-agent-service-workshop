# Summary

The workshop showcases how to use the Azure AI Agent Service to build a conversational agent that can answer questions about sales data, generate SQL queries, execute them against a read-only database, and create visualizations and Excel files for users to download. Here are some key takeaways:

1. **Context Management**: The agent uses the Azure AI Agent Service to manage conversation context.
2. **Data Analysis**: The agent can answer questions about sales data, generate SQL queries, and execute them against a read-only database.
3. **Visualizations**: The agent along with the code interpreter can create visualizations like pie charts and tables to help users understand the data better.
4. **Excel Files**: The agent can create Excel files, as well as other file types like PDFs and PowerPoint presentations, for users to download and analyze further.
5. **Security**: By making the database read-only and ensuring the application runs in a secure environment, you can mitigate security risks like SQL injection.
6. **Data Integration**: By combining data from multiple sources, like the sales database, the tent datasheet, and Bing search, the agent can provide more detailed analysis and insights.
7. **Customization**: The agent and the LLM supports multiple languages, providing a more inclusive experience for users.
